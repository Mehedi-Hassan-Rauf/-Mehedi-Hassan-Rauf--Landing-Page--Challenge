#Eye Glass Landing Page Project
I used ReactJS and tailwind css to build this project.
This project has two pages till now and those are Home, Cart pages. In-Home Page there are 6 sections =>
1. Header  : I have added the features that were mentioned in the guideline video. Every time you add a product to the cart the number shown above will be increased. Also, 
             there is a cart icon . If you click that you will be redirected to the cart page where 
             all your cart products will be there.
2. Banner  : There is a slider. I couldn't find suitable banner pictures so I used some existing pictures. I know these pictures are not perfect but still I used them to show 
             that the slider is working perfectly and you can add your desired banner pictures anytime.
3. Discount: This section is as it should be and it is fully responsive across various devices.
4. About   : This is the section where small detail is given about the company.
5. Products: This section plays a vital role in this landing page. There are shown some products. You can see Special, Latest, and Best Sell products by clicking the tabs 
             mentioning them. Also, you can add these products to your cart by clicking add to cart. To build this (add to cart) feature I could use prebuilt useShopingCart 
             npm. Instead of using it, I used Zustand to show my state management skills.
6. Footer  : Finishing the page with a great footer is essential. I used reusable component in this section as well as the previous sections.

In the cart page, you can delete added products.
